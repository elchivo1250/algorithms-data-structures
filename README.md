# Algorithms & Data Structures
This is my attempt to re-learn (and hopefully cement for all time in my mind) all the algorithms and data structures that I learned so long ago in college. I've not used many of them in a long time. This will be a good exercise that will hopefully keep me sharp and make simpler solutions to coding problems more apparent.
