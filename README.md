# Algorithms & Data Structures

This is my attempt to re-learn (and hopefully cement for all time in my mind) all the algorithms and data structures that I learned so long ago in college. I've not used many of them in a long time. This will be a good exercise that will hopefully keep me sharp and make simpler solutions to coding problems more apparent.

### Time Complexity

| Operation | Average  | Worst Case     |
| ---------:|:--------:|:--------------:|
| Search    | **O(n)** | **O(n)**       |
| Insert    | **O(1)** | **O(1)**       |
| Delete    | **O(1)** | **O(1)**       |

### Space Complexity

Average: **O(n)**

Worst Case: **O(n)**
